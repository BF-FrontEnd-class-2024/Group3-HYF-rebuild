          "I'm a 34 year old Freelance Software Developer and Team Lead from
          Leuven. What HYF means to me: It's a way for me to contribute to
          society that I feel comfortable with. I realise how lucky and
          priviledged I am, having had all possible chances in life. Giving back
          some of that luck to people who are highly motivated but weren't as
          lucky in life seems like a fair thing to do. The fact you get to work
          with the students directly and see their knowledge grow and evolve
          also helps as a motivation."
